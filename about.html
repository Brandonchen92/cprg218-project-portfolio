<h1>Who am I?</h1>

<section id="About Me">
  <p><b>About Me</b></p>
  <p>My name is Brandon Chen. I'm currently a student at SAIT, learning about Graphic Design. "diaL" is the online username that I go by, in which I show off my skills & designs. My work is mostly inspired by modern streetwear style graphics, with a pinch of "Y2K" style. I'm a graphic designer, but I'm also looking to branch out and improve my skills in other aspects like music or coding.</p>
</section>


<section id="What I do">
  <p><b>What I do</b></p>
  <p>From Graphic Design, Logo Design, to Photo Manipulation & Composites. I'm versed in After Effects, a well as Premiere, and have edited videos for myself before. I also dabble in some photography. While I am an amateur, I've been improving my skills, and when compared with previous works from years back, the changes are definitely noticable.</p>
<section>


<section id="Programs I use">
  <p><b>Programs I use</b></p>
  <p>For graphic designs, my go-to programs consist of Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom, and as of right now, Canva (The online editing program). For things like music, I've been dabbling in BandLab, but other than that I have yet to try other programs related to music. For Editing, I use Adobe Premiere. As for animation, I've only used Adobe After Effects. Outside of graphic designs, I occasionally do digital art on Clip Studio Paint.</p>

<section id="FAQ">
  <p><b>FAQ</b></p>
  <p>Frequently asked questions. Some of these questions I have concrete answers to, however some are dynamic and destined to change, as I might not currently have a concrete answer for them.</p>

      <p>As of right now, I am currently open to selling my services and designs. Keep in mind that I am still an amateur, so the prices would be cheaper, for more beginner style work. I would be happy to talk to anyone who might be interested though!</p>
