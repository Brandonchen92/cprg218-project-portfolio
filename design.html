    <img src="assets/Photo Composite 1.jpg" alt="Photo Composite I created, featuring a mix of an astronaut with a space themed background. In the astronaught's visor's, there is a mixed image of a 1950's style picture, taken approximately around that time. The theme for this was: Lost in space during the 1950s.">

    <img src="assets/Fallout_new_logo-1.png" alt="Post modernist style take on what a thumbnail for the video game: Fallout, would look like. There isn't exactly one set theme for this thumbnail, but rather more so as a proof of concept, that I can further develop if needed.">

      <h2>Fallout Thumbnail.<h2>
      <p>This was a post modernist style take on what a thumbnail for the video game: Fallout, would look like. There isn't exactly one set theme for this thumbnail, but rather more so as a proof of concept, that I can further develop if needed.</p>

  <div class="card">
    <img src="assets/Enigma 2.png" alt="Square graphic that features a main theme on the word 'enigma'. There is the text 'designing test' at the very top, with some filler text on the right that features the definition of enigma. The main design features the word enigma in english 3 times, as well as in Japanese 4 times. at the bottom of the graphic, there is text that says 'Test Document', as well as more filler text on the side, that is a disclaimer. the main colors are beige and dark brown.">
    <div class="card-content">
      <h2>Enigma.<h2>
      <p>A more experimental graphic, for this one, I was experimenting with different fonts, and a mix of Japanese text. I also tried to incorporate more text on the page, to give it a style, and to make it seem more enticing. The more details, the more interesting the graphic, is sort of what I thought about when making this one.</p>
    </div>

  <div class="card">
    <img src="assets/Pursue.png" alt="Square graphic that incorporates the main theme of 'pursue', featuring the word 'pursue' 3 times in a row, all on top of each other. half of the graphic is black, the other half is magenta/fuschia. the text on the fuschia side is black, and the text on the black side is fuschia colored. There is japanese text that changes color on the left side, as in half is magenta, half is black. There is also the definition of pursue on the bottom of the graphic.">
    <div class="card-content">
      <h2>Pursue.<h2>
      <p>Another experimental graphic, though this is the type I might actually want to implement onto a piece of clothing. The main theme for this one is 'Pursue', so it features a definition of pursue, as well as Japanese text for a more graphic feel. For this one, I used a color that I usually don't incorporate into my designs, that being magenta/fuschia.</p>
